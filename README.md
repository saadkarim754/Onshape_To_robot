a simple project which was to make a robot in onshape and make its Urdf file using onshape_to_robot library (https://onshape-to-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html ) and then simulating in some design tool .

Also we have the cad files and assembly in the rar file, along with a separate urdf created from solidworks 2022 that is compatible with coppelia sim , (there is also the lua script for coppelia to test the robot , once imported.)
